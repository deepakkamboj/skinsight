## üîÅ Flow:

### 1. User Interaction

-   Mobile app or web chatbot.
    
-   Inputs:
    
    -   Lifestyle habits
        
    -   Family medical history
        
    -   Image uploads
        
    -   Symptom descriptions
        
    -   Chat queries
        

### 2. LangChain Agent (LangGraph)

-   Orchestrates the workflow.
    
-   Routes queries based on user intent.
    
-   Connects to:
    
    -   Multi-Agent System (MAS)
        
    -   Bing Search API
        
    -   GPT-4 API
        
    -   Memory / History storage
        

### 3. Multi-Agent System (MAS)

-   Specialized agents:
    
    -   ImageScanAgent
        
    -   FollowUpQuestionAgent
        
    -   ConditionDetectionAgent
        
    -   SymptomTrackerAgent
        
    -   NotificationAgent
        
    -   SpecialistReferralAgent
        
    -   ProductRecommendationAgent
        
    -   PersonalizedCareAgent
        

### 4. Functions and Tools

-   Integrates:
    
    -   Google Vision, AWS Rekognition
        
    -   Google Places API
        
    -   Skincare Product APIs
        
    -   TensorFlow, PyTorch ML Models
        

### 5. Retrieval and Answering (RAG Pipeline)

-   For evidence-backed answers:
    
    -   Load documents (PDF, CSV, JSON)
        
    -   Split into chunks
        
    -   Embed using OpenAI Embeddings
        
    -   Store vectors in FAISS or Pinecone
        
    -   Retrieve relevant chunks during queries
        

### 6. External Search (Bing)

-   For any gaps in internal knowledge base.
    

### 7. Memory / History Storage

-   Store encrypted session data.
    
-   Maintain conversation context.
    

### 8. Final Response

-   Composed and personalized message to user.
## Components

-   **Frontend Application**
    
    -   User interacts through web or mobile apps.
        
-   **Backend API Layer**
    
    -   Handles user requests, routes to services.
        
-   **Database**
    
    -   Stores structured healthcare data.
        
-   **Vector Store (FAISS or Pinecone)**
    
    -   Stores embeddings for fast similarity search.
        
-   **LLM (Large Language Model)**
    
    -   Processes queries, generates intelligent responses.
        
-   **Authentication Service**
    
    -   Manages user access, ensures HIPAA compliance.
        
-   **Monitoring and Logging**
    
    -   Observability, issue detection.
        

## Workflow

1.  User submits query via frontend.
    
2.  Backend API authenticates the request.
    
3.  Query embedding generated and matched against **FAISS/Pinecone**.
    
4.  Matched results are passed to **LLM**.
    
5.  LLM generates response based on matched context.
    
6.  Response sent back to frontend.
